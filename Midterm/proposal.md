### 1. What will (likely) be the name of your game? 

	“Eating Snake”

### 2. In a paragraph or two, tell me about your game and your implementation.

	My game is about a Snake who wants to grow as soon as 
	possible. Trough keeps eating, and the player will 
	find some surprises when it becomes longer.
	
	For my implementation, I will have home screen at the 
	begginning, and there might ask player do you want to 
	choose one player or two (ideally). Also, I will have
	some state machines such as provide user to pause or 
	restart the game. Moreover, the Snake will have level 
	up implement when the score reaching a number.

### 3. Good outcome deliverable – Write a list of features of what you WILL achieve no matter what.

	・Snake will grow up through eat the food in the game.
	
	・Snake will dead if it touch the wall, obstacles 
	  or itself.
	
	・Nice-look game enviroment.
	
	・Home screen and a rule section.
	
	・Game over and restart bottom.



### 4. Better outcome deliverable – Expand your previously written list of features to include what you THINK you will accomplish before the project’s deadline.

	・Random props for get the special skill, 
	 such as speed up, double score etc.
	
	・Snake will randomly change the body color 
	 when it comes to different body size.

### 5. Best outcome deliverable – Expand your previously written list of features to include what you HOPE you will accomplish before the project’s deadline.

	・Implement the level maker of my game. 
	
	・It will be 2 level in total, 
	  and the second level will have enemies need to 
	  escape.
	
	・An option to ask the user are you single player 
	  or two players at the home page.


### 6. In a paragraph or two, outline your next steps and tell me what additional skills you will require and what topics you might research for the completion of this project.
	Next step:
	・Starting design the Snake, background, and home page.
	・Planing and writing the Snake movement in C# script.
	-
	Possible reserch topics:
	・How to ask the user do they want single or two 
	   players at the home page.
	・Some sound effect in the game. 
	  (game over, eating sound etc)
